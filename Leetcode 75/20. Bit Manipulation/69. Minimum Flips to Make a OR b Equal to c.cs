/*
Leetcode 1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c  
Topic: Bit Manipulation

Approach:
- Use bitwise operations to evaluate each bit of a, b, and c.
- For each bit:
    - If cBit is 1: 
        - At least one of aBit or bBit must be 1. 
        - If both are 0, we need 1 flip.
    - If cBit is 0:
        - Both aBit and bBit must be 0.
        - Count 1 flip for each bit that is 1.

Time Complexity: O(32) â†’ O(1), since integers are 32 bits  
Space Complexity: O(1)
